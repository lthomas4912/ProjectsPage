	<h2 id="about">About </h2>
		<p class="better">Completely excited to have learned this skill of creating a webpage. Thank you to Philly Tech Sistas for their guidance. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I have made a huge transistion in my life and really excited about all this new career in software development has to offer. My background has primarily been in the food industry since I was 15 years old. September of 2018, I attended an information session by Zip Code Wilmington, and was immediately blown away by the administration and the alumni. Thankfully, I was accepted into the program and have since completed it! Currently working on gaining more skills and improving upon those I gained from the bootcamp. This is an example of a newly acquired skill, which is far from finished.
